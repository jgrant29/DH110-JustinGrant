# UX Interactive Prototype 2 (Starts at Interactive Prototype)
## DH110, Spring 2021, UCLA, by Justin Grant

### Description of project 
This project serves to increase the flow of hrsimple.com.  My prototyping tool of choice is Sketch.  
This project will help improve the functionality of hrsimple.com's information services for all age groups and especially for seniors with proximity theories.  This project's main task is to re-design most of the web pages with specificity related to users' flow entering the blog page and continue through to a goal.  I aim to expose users to a complete list of online books for federal laws.  The task the prototype demonstrates is simple — a user enters the Federal book, selects a topic, reads the information, and has the tool necessary to navigate a large amount of data.

### Screen design
in the screen design, I created the cart and search icon.  The hamburger icon is from material UI components.  The social media image is a list with a picture.  I also created the "Menu" button.  At the bottom of the secondary screen (chapter), there is a fixed footer with navigation buttons and links to move from one chapter to the next.  The button icons are arrows with text.  The first three "Chapters" in the Federal Human Resources Manual have unique text, but the rest of the "Chapters" have the same text as the first chapter, "Recruiting and hiring". 

### Impression test
The user remarked on the simplicity of the mobile website.  The navigation was easy to follow, but the bottom buttons are too small for a senior user (any user). My next prototype will focus on improving the button navigation buttons. 

#### Impression Test from 5.12.2021 from Class (my wife is really busy with her Ph.D., so this is the best I can do):
"I see a lot of text, as this is the text for a manual. 2. It looks like this is a table of contents for the Federal Human Resources Manual, where each chapter is listed separately to access what you want more efficiently. 3. It seems that I can find information about the employee-related laws that could affect business operations. 4. I think this prototype looks very similar to professionally made applications, as the text, color scheme, and layout all mimic professional apps. I like how the contents page is not too cluttered, but I think that the pages are very long and can be shortened (not sure if this is just a product of the Sketch website, though). Another thing I would enhance is the Menu button: I think it could be larger and potentially moved to the top instead of the three lines."

I learned a lot from the impression test.  Most reviewers claimed that the website is professional and legitimate.  However, the signifiers (buttons and icons) were either too small or not in the correct places.  For the next phase, I need to work on the placement of the navigation (back button, social share links, menu button, and navigation at the footer)

### Design System

I used Helvetica font throughout the entire design.   Header 1 at 14px and Header 2 at 12px.  The color scheme, as described above, on the draft prototype unit is Foreground #590B0B and Background #F9F9F9.  The first  foreground color selection (wine red) #590B0B with (light grey) background #F9F9F9.  The second color scheme green foreground #02591B with light grey background #F9F9F9.  As for the dark mode color scheme, pink-ish foreground #ECAAAA with black background #000000. 

I selected Helvetica because it is a universal font, is easy to read, and is suitable for senior users.  The color choice mocked the initial design of hrsimple.com, but I chose a darker red.  I chose green because green is the opposite of red.  I used Adobe Kuler to chose the green color by pasting 590B0B in the center block and selecting "Complementary".

#### Walkthrough
When interacting with the interactive prototype on Sketch, I would like you to complete three goals.  The first goal is to find employment law information regarding Background Checks.  Use the navigation menu on the Dashboard to find the information you need.  Try to move to the next chapter, return to "My Dashboard. The second goal is to Contact an Attorney.  I would like you to start at My Dashboard and navigate through the attorney contact goal.  Select the best method, "Zoom", fill out the information, and end at the confirmation.  From confirmation, please navigate back to "My Dashboard".  The third task has fewer steps than the first and second goals.  I would like you to find a form on "My Dashboard" related to workplace injuries.  Once you're on the downloadable form, navigate to "contact us" or "privacy policy". For visual instructions, please see the Wireflow (Diagram), three images below.

### Reflection
This project was eye-opening.  I found it frustrating trying to mimic my high-fidelity prototype and an actual website.  However, from this prototyping project, I implemented a navigation feature of Users with a product behind the paywall of hrsimple.com.  See the below image for an example. 

<img width="100%" alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-19 at 1 29 01 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8107598/118879978-2f257d00-b8a6-11eb-992a-ba4c3e20a079.png">

Another realization I found during this process was saving time by creating one symbol or object to be replicated across the entire prototype.  I discovered my lack of organization and streamlining features throughout the whole prototype when I wanted to change the color of a button.  With one or two artboards, changing color is easy, but as soon as I started designing over twenty artboards, it was necessary to develop a button symbol to use everywhere.  

Putting myself in a customer's shoes is so helpful.  While I'll never know what it's like to be another user, I can sympathize with user frustration or ease-of-use by designing high-fidelity prototypes and mapping each prototype out through cognitive walkthroughs.  Overall, I will continue utilizing prototyping software to hash out ideas.
