#### John Scott Smith Scenario
**Setting: Workplace injury**
**Event:** This morning, one of John’s employees slipped on wet flooring, hit his head, and broke his hand.  No other employee was around to witness the accident, but the employee who slipped and fell is claiming that it is the companies fault for the wet flooring.  After calling an ambulance, John investigated the site of the accident and found water on the ground but he couldn’t find the source of the water.  The roof didn’t have a leak in it and there were no water lines or leaky pipes.  

**Situation:** Attempting to find relavant information in short timeframe
**Task:** John called his attorney, but his attorney was not available until the next day.  John’s boss insisted that he begin investigating the accident immediately.  John searched his employment law books for workplace accidents, but the book was written in legal jargon that he could not understand, so he searched the internet for advice. To his disappointment, majority of the website he found with relevant information had a pay-wall.  

**Goal:** To find information to protect company from this mornings accident.
Action: He wasn’t  authorized to purchase anything on the company card unless it was authorized by the CFO and the COO.  Unfortunately, both executives were out of the office for the day.  So, John signed-up for a free trial to hrsimple.com.  After searching through hrsimple.com, John found a sample form to fill out and help  detail the accident.  He also found some basic information about workplace injuries and how to deal with those injuries.  However,  he couldn’t find any information about how to investigate other employees, and the employee who slipped and feel on the wet floor. 

**Solution:** Free one-hour consultation with attorney
Thankfully, hrsimple.com offers a free one-hour consultation with an attorney.   He was able to  understand his rights under law and conducted the workplace investigation. 

**Problem:**  Getting reimbursed from CFO.

#### Vivian L. Jackson Scenario
**Setting:** LGBTQ — Locally, Nationally, Globally
**Event:** Twitter’s headquarters has policies and procedures for LGBTQ employees, but other locations throughout America and across the world are slow to implement Twitter’s policies.  As  of last week, Twitter has had 25 complaints about transgender bathrooms.  Some of the complaints are from the transgender community, while others of from female employees complaining about transgender males using the women’s bathrooms.  

**Situation:** How to implement a bathroom policies for all employees
**Task:** Vivian is the HR Manager for Twitter’s headquarters and oversees national and worldwide HR departments.  Thankfully, the headquarters in California are up to date and progressive with the employment law practices surrounding LGBTQ community.  However, other states are not  up to speed.   Vivian needs to understand how implement policies and procedures that are in-line with Twitter’s headquarter location.  The only problem is that a lot of buildings have two bathrooms: one male and one female.  She needs to find information regarding transgender bathrooms.

**Goal:** Implement a company policy for transgenders without creating complications between other genders.
Action: Vivian requested a virtual meeting with her global HR team to understand how to implement transgender bathrooms in states and countries without transgender laws.  She began researching transgender bathroom online and stumbled across a blog post by hrsimple.com.  In the post, hrsimple.com gave specific guidelines to make everyone happy.  The website recommends a unisex bathroom, and things not to do such as asking employees to provide medical documentation.  hrsimple also discusses how to curate a policy, and  provides an example policy for the United States.
Problem: Vivian needs to find global laws on transgender bathrooms.  Unfortunately, hrsimple.com does not provide international law.  

**Solution:** Find as much online information as possible before contacting a international attorney.  Vivian took  hrsimple.com's advice on transgender bathrooms.  In addition to hrsimple.com, she looked up other policies and procedures on shrm.org.  Altogether,  her team was able to gather enough information from the united states before contacting an international attorney.
