#### John Scott Smith Scenario
**Setting: Workplace injury**
**Event:** This morning, one of John’s employees slipped on wet flooring, hit his head, and broke his hand.  No other employee was around to witness the accident, but the employee who slipped and fell is claiming that it is the companies fault for the wet flooring.  After calling an ambulance, John investigated the site of the accident and found water on the ground but he couldn’t find the source of the water.  The roof didn’t have a leak in it and there were no water lines or leaky pipes.  

**Situation:** Attempting to find relavant information in short timeframe
**Task:** John called his attorney, but his attorney was not available until the next day.  John’s boss insisted that he begin investigating the accident immediately.  John searched his employment law books for workplace accidents, but the book was written in legal jargon that he could not understand, so he searched the internet for advice. To his disappointment, majority of the website he found with relevant information had a pay-wall.  

**Goal:** To find information to protect company from this mornings accident.
Action: He wasn’t  authorized to purchase anything on the company card unless it was authorized by the CFO and the COO.  Unfortunately, both executives were out of the office for the day.  So, John signed-up for a free trial to hrsimple.com.  After searching through hrsimple.com, John found a sample form to fill out and help  detail the accident.  He also found some basic information about workplace injuries and how to deal with those injuries.  However,  he couldn’t find any information about how to investigate other employees, and the employee who slipped and feel on the wet floor. 

**Solution:** Free one-hour consultation with attorney
Thankfully, hrsimple.com offers a free one-hour consultation with an attorney.   He was able to  understand his rights under law and conducted the workplace investigation. 

**Problem:**  Getting reimbursed from CFO.
