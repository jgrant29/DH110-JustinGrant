# Assignment 02 Usability Testing (UT)

## Introduction of DOL.gov website
DOL.gov is a website ran by the federal goverenment in the United States of America.  DOL is an acrynm from the "Department of Labor".  I chose this website because labor laws and regulations not only effect businesses, they effect employees too.  While "Age Discrimination" laws are not always talked about, many seniors and older people experience these age discrimination in the workplace.  This fact is one of the reasons why I wanted to perform User Testing on DOL.gov.  

## The rationale behind UT with the list of the usability issues
The rationale beind the UT testing goes beyond Age Discrimination in the workplace.  Majority of labor and employment laws are not written for laypersons, which is why I decided to perform UT on DOL.gov.  For example, "Section 188 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998" prohibits discrimination in the workplace.  But the actual law is cryptic in the sense that to understand the law, a layperson would have to pay for an attorney.  If you're interesting in understanding the complexities of employment laws in the United States, <a href="https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/discrimination/agedisc" aria-label="DOL.gov discrimination page">please visit the page on DOL.gov</a>.  The link provided will take you to a web page that gives a general overview of discrmination in the workplace.  However, to learn more, you must click on another link such as the links under "Laws on this Topic". One of the links under "Law on this Topic" is listed as "29 USC ยง621 - Age Discrimination in Employment".  The ยง621 is where employment laws get complicated for employees and even employers.  Furthermore, this area on DOL.gov takes the user to another website <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section621&num=0&edition=prelim" aria-label="External link example from DOL.gov">here</a>.  The information becomes even more compliacted form there.

## The purpose of the usability testing on DOL.gov to improve the web/app from the user's perspective
I believe it is a fundamental right for citizens and employees and employers to understand their rights under law.  Yet, for majority of citizens in the United States, and probably the world, know little about their consitutional rights.  That is, I believe a website such as DOL.gov should provide information and advice about laws and regulations that are not cryptic and hard to understand.  Laws, regardless if they are property rights or employment rights, should be written in plain simple english and easily navigatable and accessible for all citizens of a country.  After all, laws are designed to protect citizens and the country from corruption and unfair justice.  

## The UT setting (where, portable minimalistic lab), equipment(computer, software)
The UT setting was virtual.  I used Zoom to conduct my usability testing.  My lab was a small office space and the user being tested was located in a bedroom.  Both of use used desktop computers with iOS software.  The desktop computers where equipped with a native camera and microphone. 

## The nature of the usability testing
This entire test was a pilot test with someone I am familiar with on a daily basis. After the pilot test, my audience would be elderly people in the worplace. 

# Describe the process (ex. Background questions, pretest, posttest) and what was measured (ex. Ease of use)

Include the link to the test materials/script/questionnaire (ex.google form)

Reflection: what you learned during the pilot test, what went well and what went not so well; how you want to improve your UT in the future
