# Assignment 02 Usability Testing (UT)

## Introduction of DOL.gov website
DOL.gov is a website ran by the federal goverenment in the United States of America.  DOL is an acrynm from the "Department of Labor".  I chose this website because labor laws and regulations not only effect businesses, they effect employees too.  While "Age Discrimination" laws are not always talked about, many seniors and older people experience these age discrimination in the workplace.  This fact is one of the reasons why I wanted to perform User Testing on DOL.gov.  

## Rationale behind UT with the list of the usability issues
The rationale beind the UT testing goes beyond Age Discrimination in the workplace.  Majority of labor and employment laws are not written for laypersons, which is why I decided to perform UT on DOL.gov.  For example, "Section 188 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998" prohibits discrimination in the workplace.  But the actual law is cryptic in the sense that to understand the law, a layperson would have to pay for an attorney.  If you're interesting in understanding the complexities of employment laws in the United States, <a href="https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/discrimination/agedisc" aria-label="DOL.gov discrimination page">please visit the page on DOL.gov</a>.  The link provided will take you to a web page that gives a general overview of discrmination in the workplace.  However, to learn more, you must click on another link such as the links under "Laws on this Topic". One of the links under "Law on this Topic" is listed as "29 USC ยง621 - Age Discrimination in Employment".  The ยง621 is where employment laws get complicated for employees and even employers.  Furthermore, this area on DOL.gov takes the user to another website <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section621&num=0&edition=prelim" aria-label="External link example from DOL.gov">here</a>.  The information becomes even more compliacted form there.

## Purpose of the usability testing on DOL.gov
I believe it is a fundamental right for citizens and employees and employers to understand their rights under law.  Yet, for majority of citizens in the United States, and probably the world, know little about their consitutional rights.  That is, I believe a website such as DOL.gov should provide information and advice about laws and regulations that are not cryptic and hard to understand.  Laws, regardless if they are property rights or employment rights, should be written in plain simple english and easily navigatable and accessible for all citizens of a country.  After all, laws are designed to protect citizens and the country from corruption and unfair justice.  

## UT setting
The UT setting was virtual.  I used Zoom to conduct my usability testing.  My lab was a small office space and the user being tested was located in a bedroom.  Both of use used desktop computers with iOS software.  The desktop computers where equipped with a native camera and microphone. 

## Nature of the usability testing
This entire test was a pilot test with someone I am familiar with on a daily basis. After the pilot test, my audience would be elderly people in the worplace. 

## Process
I set up the usability testing with an introduction, informed consent, background questions, pre-test questions, three tasks, post-test questionnaire, system usability scale (SUS), production satisfaction card, and personal questions.  The entire process was conducted on Google Forms. 

Majority of the measurements used were ease-of-use, and the funcationality of the websit i.e. how easy was each task for the user?  was the user able to find exact information to make them feel confident about make decisions or knowing their rights as a senior employee in the workplace.

## My Reflection and experience
After setting up the process on Google Forms, I felt very confident about the conducting the UT.  However, I was underprepared.  I had to read the introduction to the test subject and kept fumbling over my words and phrases.  I believe this initial set up, in a real UT, would start of the interview with a rocky beginning.  That is, the person conducting the interview should be confident and prepared to communicate with the test subject.  After I finished the introduction and the informed consent, I feel like my confidence level increased.  I clearly stated the background questions, pre-test questions, three tasks, and the other processes.  The number one take away for me is to ask the user more questions about how they are feeling or what they are thinking when they perform a task.  I merely asked the questions and was indirect in answering any of the quesitons.  I think my indirectness was a good thing because I didn't guide or influence any spcific decisions. H owever, I should have improvised more with the test subject as they moved through the website.  Additionally, I learned how much influence an interviewer can have on a test subject.  That is, the appeal to authority is a complicated process and should be handled delicatly while conducting UT.  The one example that comes to mind is the book and experiement by Stanley Milgram "Obedience to Authority".

Again, the number one thing I would improve is the improvised questioning that is crucial to pushing the test subject to uncovering valuable usability issues.  Also, I would reacher the website or app being studied and try to find more weaknesses and severity ratings.
