### Human Resources Heuristics

I am the web developer and designer for a company that produces HR material for employers and HR Professionals.  This project's goal is to help me understand how HR websites differ from hrsimple.com. My intent is to learn what is missing from hrsimple.com by performing heuristics on competitor websites.
