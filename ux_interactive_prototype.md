### Description of project 
This project service to increase the flow of hrsimple.com.  The process of this project will help improve the functionality of the hrsimple.com's information services for all age groups and especially for seniors with proximity theories.  The main task for this project is to re-design majority of the web pages  with specificity  related to the flow of users entering the blog page and continue through to a goal.  The goal I am aiming for to expose users to a complete list of an online book for federal laws.  The task the prototype demonstrates is simple — a user enters the Federal book, selects a topic, reads the information, and has the tool necessary to navigate large amount of information. 

### Screen design
in the screen design, I created the cart and search icon.  The hamburger icon is from material ui components.  The social media images is a list with a picture.  The “Menu” button was also created by me.  At the bottom of the secondary screen (chapter), there is a fixed footer with navigation tabs to move from one chapter to the next.  The button icons are arrows with text.  

### Impression test
The user remarked on the simplicity of the mobile website.  The navigation was easy to follow but the bottom buttons are too small for a senior user (any users to be honest). 

### Accessibility (color-contrast) check

#### First color: Foreground color #A62424 with Background Color #FFFFFF passed by WCAG AA and WCAG AAA on Normal Text, Large Text and Graphical Objects and User Interface Components.

#### Design System

I used Helvetica font throughout the entire design.   Header 1 at 14px and Header 2 at 12px.  Color scheme, as described above, on the draft prototype unit is Foreground #000000 and Background #FFFFFF.  The first  foreground color selection (red) #A62424 with (white) background #FFFFFF.  The second color scheme pink-ish? foreground #ECAAAA with black background #000000.  As for the third color scheme, green foreground #24A649 with white background #FFFFFF. 

I selected Helvetica because it is a universal font, is easy to read, and is suitable for senior users.  The color choice mocked the initial design of hrsimple.com, except for the green.  I chose green because green is the opposite of red.  I used Adobe Kuler to chose the green color by pasting A62424 in the center block and selecting “Complementary”.  I should have selected a darker green #02591B which was right next to the lighter green #24A649.   For the second run of this project, I would choose the darker green for prototyping with a customer.
