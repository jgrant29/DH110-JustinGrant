# UX Interactive Prototype
## DH110, Spring 2021, UCLA, by Justin Grant

### Description of project 
This project serves to increase the flow of hrsimple.com.  My prototyping tool of choice is Sketch.  
This project will help improve the functionality of the hrsimple.com's information services for all age groups and especially for seniors with proximity theories.  This project's main task is to re-design most of the web pages with specificity related to the flow of users entering the blog page and continue through to a goal.  I aim to expose users to a complete list of online books for federal laws.  The task the prototype demonstrates is simple — a user enters the Federal book, selects a topic, reads the information, and has the tool necessary to navigate a large amount of data.

### Screen design
in the screen design, I created the cart and search icon.  The hamburger icon is from material UI components.  The social media image is a list with a picture.  I also created the "Menu" button.  At the bottom of the secondary screen (chapter), there is a fixed footer with navigation tabs to move from one chapter to the next.  The button icons are arrows with text.  

### Impression test
The user remarked on the simplicity of the mobile website.  The navigation was easy to follow, but the bottom buttons are too small for a senior user (any user). My next prototype will focus on improving the button navigation buttons.

#### Impression Test from 5.12.2021:
"I see a lot of text, as this is the text for a manual. 2. It looks like this is a table of contents for the Federal Human Resources Manual where each chapter is listed separately to access what you want more efficiently. 3. It seems that I can find information about the employee related laws that could affect business operations. 4. I think that this prototype looks very similar to professionally made applications, as the text, color scheme, and layout all mimic professional apps. I like how the table of contents page is not too cluttered, but I think that the pages are very long and can be shortened (not sure if this is just a product of the Sketch website though). Another thing I would enhance is the Menu button: I think it could be larger and potentially moved to the top instead of the three lines."

I learned a lot from the impression test.  Most reviewers claimed that the website is professional and legitamite.  However, the signifiers (buttons, and icons) were either too small or not in the correct places.  For the next phase, I need to work on the placement of the navigation (back button, social share links, menu button, and navigation at the footer)

### Accessibility (color-contrast) check

#### First Color
Foreground color #A62424 with Background Color #FFFFFF passed by WCAG AA and WCAG AAA on Normal Text, Large Text and Graphical Objects and User Interface Components.  

##### First Color Contrast Ratio: 7.24:1

### Design System

I used Helvetica font throughout the entire design.   Header 1 at 14px and Header 2 at 12px.  The color scheme, as described above, on the draft prototype unit is Foreground #000000 and Background #FFFFFF.  The first  foreground color selection (red) #A62424 with (white) background #FFFFFF.  The second color scheme pink-ish? foreground #ECAAAA with black background #000000.  As for the third color scheme, green foreground #24A649 with white background #FFFFFF. 

I selected Helvetica because it is a universal font, is easy to read, and is suitable for senior users.  The color choice mocked the initial design of hrsimple.com, except for the green.  I chose green because green is the opposite of red.  I used Adobe Kuler to chose the green color by pasting A62424 in the center block and selecting "Complementary".  I should have chosen a darker green #02591B next to the lighter green #24A649.   For the second run of this project, I would choose the darker green for prototyping with a customer.
