# DH110-JustinGrant

## Human Resources Mobile
This project serves to increase the flow of hrsimple.com. My prototyping tool of choice is Sketch.
This project will help improve the functionality of hrsimple.com's information services for all age groups and especially for seniors with proximity theories. This project's main task is to re-design most of the web pages with specificity related to users' flow entering the blog page and continue through to a goal. I aim to expose users to a complete list of online books for federal laws. The task the prototype demonstrates is simple â€” a user enters the Federal book, selects a topic, reads the information, and has the tool necessary to navigate a large amount of data.

## Design Statment 
hrsimple.com does not have a mobile application, so I wanted to create one for myself!
