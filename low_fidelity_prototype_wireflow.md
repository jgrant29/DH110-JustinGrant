# DH110 Assignment 04: Persona+Scenario
## Low Fidelity Prototype
### *Created by Justin Grant*

This project is focused on user research for human resources professionals.  In conducting this research, I want to understand how human resources professionals handle employment law issues with state and federal compliance requirements.  Employment law is just one aspect of human resources, so I want to find efficient solutions to help these professionals find the exact answers they need to get back to working on other assignments.  
 
Regarding my personas, I did not focus on seniors with at least one person.  Vivian is 35 and works for Twitter.  The other persona is John, who is 49.  He has about 15 years before he is classified as a senior.  So, for this project, I will generalize my wireframes and wireflow to John and Vivian as senior citizens who are human resources professionals.  

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to envision what a user persona goes through.  It puts the UX Designer and Researcher in the user's shoes and attempts to weed out potential problems or bottlenecks.  Most importantly, I think low-fidelity prototyping helps the  UX person/team discover potential product design issues or solutions that were not yet considered or invented.  Overall, this process allows the person/team to apply the abstract level of thinking about user research, personas, and contextual inquiries into a tangible product.  Essentially, it's the blueprint of the actual product.  


### Persona01 John: Wireflow "John"
John is an almost-retired HR professional how needs to find information about a workplace accident quickly.  An employee slipped and fell on a wet surface.  John called an ambulance because the employee had severe injuries.  While John usually looks up information in a physical book, his book did not have anything on workplace injuries, so he took to the internet to find an attorney to contact.  John found himself on hrsimple.com.  From this website, he set up a time to talk with an attorney. 

#### Features for John
1) Go to the website to contact attorney. 2) Lands on Home page and selects "Contact Attorney" 3) Select "Phone" as communication preference 4) Selects "1 Hour" for timeframe attorney calls him 5) Selects the estimated time (15 minutes) he needs to talk with attorney. 6) Fills out information and payment 7) Confirmation on website.

### Persona02 Vivan: Wireflow “Vivian”
Vivian is an older Senior HR professional who deals with many young people at Twitter Inc. She's a progressive, older HR professional. She wants to implement a bathroom policy for LGBT community Twitter employees.  The problem she is encountering is finding information on how to implement a progressive workplace policy internationally when a significant portion of the world does not support the LGBT community. 

#### Features for Vivian: 
1) Initiates a meeting with the executive HR team with instructions to find employment law online.  2) Vivian searches for information and visits hrsimple.com 3) she selects "Laws" 4) She selects "Gender and Bathroom Policies" 5) Selects "Forms and Policies" button on "Gender and Bathroom Policies" page 6) hrsimple.com displays a list of forms to download, she select "Gender and Bathroom Policies" 7) hrsimple.com redirects her to a "Sign up" page.  8A) Vivian fills out information to download the form 8b) Vivian exits hrsimple.com 9) Vivian is redirected to a page that says "Welcome to hrsimple!".  The page automatically downloads the form to her browser's specified location.

### Person03 Random User: Wireflow "Free Trial"
1) A random senior citizen lands on hrsimple.com looking for a free trial to read about employment laws and download forms and policies. 2) random select "Free Trial" 3) Random is sent to "Sign up" form to fill out basic information for free trial 4) User receives a confirmation email. 5) User confirms email. 6) User successfully accesses hrsimple.com 7) User cannot download forms and policies because they are on a free trial. 8) hrsimple.com suggests purchasing a product to access forms and policies.

### Testing the wireflow with another person 
Since my test was simple, the tester was able to complete her task.  She made aware a few frustrations about the details and options presented while performing one of the tasks (John's Task).  Still, afterward, she retracted her remark that the wireflow was intuitive and helpful to understand the process for John. 

I would address this problem by having fewer options during the checkout process.  Maybe just one section that starts and 1-hour consultation versus multiple possibilities.

### Reflection

#### Summary of the process, what went smoothly or differently from your expectation

Initially, I tried to draw wireframes on an iPad but become frustrated with having to confine myself to a small screen and pressing buttons to change the look and feel of my low fidelity design.  So, I used a whiteboard to draw out my design.  It would have been helpful if the markers were not thick.  Thinner markers would help.  In the future, I would prefer a chalkboard. 

I am satisfied with the wireframe and wireflow process with my tester.  Also, I am satisfied with the process of making wireframe and wireflows.  This process is a cost-effective way to think about a potential product or solution to a problem.  It helps designers and researchers understand bottlenecks and other issues concerning possible designs.  I like to think of this process as architecture.  First, an architect designs a house on paper.  Then, the architect analyzes how a user walks through the house or building.  

Overall, I would change the design by adding all possible scenarios and user flows to one document.  I created three, but one will do just fine if all three potential movements, goals, tasks are configured in the original design.
