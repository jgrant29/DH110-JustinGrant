# Low Fidelity Prototype

This project is focused on user research for human resources professionals.  In conducting this research, I want to understand and learn how human resources professionals handle employment law issues with state and federal compliance requirements.  Employment law is just one aspect of human resources, so I want to find efficient solutions to  help these professionals find the exact answers they need so they can get back to working on other assignments.  
 
Regarding my personas, I did not focus on seniors with at least  one person.  Vivian is 35 and works for Twitter.  The other persona is John who is 49.  He has about 15 years before he is classified as a senior.  So, for this  project, I will generalize my wireframes and wireflow to any human resources professional.  The reason for this is because HR professionals who  are senior citizens will mostly likely search for similar employment law issues as Vivian and John.

## Persona01 John: Wireflow “John”
John needs to find information about a workplace accident in a short timeframe.  An employee slipped and fell on a wet surface.  John called and ambulance because the employee had  severe injuries.  While John usually looks up information in a physical book, his book did not have  anything on workplace injuries, so he took to the internet to find an attorney to contact.  John found himself on hrsimple.com.  From this website, he set up a time to talk with an attorney. 

### Features for John
1) Go to website to contact attorney. 2) Lands on Home page and selects “Contact Attorney” 3) Select “Phone” as communication preference 4) Selects “1 Hour” for timeframe attorney calls him 5) Selects the estimated time (15 minutes) he needs to talk with attorney. 6) Fills out information and payment 7) Confirmation on website. 

## Persona02 Vivan: Wireflow “Vivian”
Vivian is an older Senior HR professional who deals with a lot of young people at Twitter Inc.  She’s is a progressive, older HR professional and wants to implement a bathroom policy for the LGBT community Twitter  employees.  The problem she  is encountering is finding information on how to implement a progressive workplace policy internationally when a significant portion of the world does not support the LGBT community. 

### Features for Vivian: 
1) Initiates a meeting with executive HR team with instructions to find employment law online.  2) Vivian searches for information and visists hrsimple.com 3) she selects “Laws” 4) She selects “Gender and Bathroom Policies” 5) Selects “Forms and Policies” button on “Gender and Bathroom Policies” page 6) hrsimple.com displays a list of forms to download, she select “Gender and Bathroom Policies” 7) hrsimple.com redirects her to a “Sign up” page.  8A) Vivian fills out information to download the form 8b) Vivian exist hrsimple.com 9) Vivian is redirected to a page that says “Welcome to hrsimple!”.  The page automatically downloads the form to her browsers specified location. 

## Person03 Random User: Wireflow “Free Trial”
1) A random senior citizen lands on hrsimple.com looking for a free trial to read about employment laws and download forms and policies. 2) random select “Free Trial” 3) Random is sent to “Sign up” form to fill out basic information for free trial 4) User receives confirmation email. 5) User confirms email. 6) User successfully accesses hrsimple.com 7) User cannot download forms and polices because they are on a free trial. 8) hrsimple.com suggests purchasing a product to access forms and policies. 

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to envision what a user persona goes through.  It puts the UX Designer and Researcher in the  users shoes and attempts to weed out any potential problems or bottlenecks.  Most  importantly, I think low-fidelity prototyping helps the  UX person / team discover potential product design issues or solutions that were not  yet thought of or invented.  Overall, this process helps the person / team to apply the abstract level of thinking about  user research, personas, and contextual inquires into a tangible product.  Essentially, it’s the blueprint of the actual product.
