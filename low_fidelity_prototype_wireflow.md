# DH110 Assignment 04: Persona+Scenario
## Low Fidelity Prototype
### *Created by Justin Grant*

This project is focused on user research for human resources professionals.  In conducting this research, I want to understand and learn how human resources professionals handle employment law issues with state and federal compliance requirements.  Employment law is just one aspect of human resources, so I want to find efficient solutions to  help these professionals find the exact answers they need so they can get back to working on other assignments.  
 
Regarding my personas, I did not focus on seniors with at least  one person.  Vivian is 35 and works for Twitter.  The other persona is John who is 49.  He has about 15 years before he is classified as a senior.  So, for this  project, I will generalize my wireframes and wireflow to John and Vivian as senior citizens who are human resources professional.  

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to envision what a user persona goes through.  It puts the UX Designer and Researcher in the  users shoes and attempts to weed out any potential problems or bottlenecks.  Most  importantly, I think low-fidelity prototyping helps the  UX person / team discover potential product design issues or solutions that were not  yet thought of or invented.  Overall, this process helps the person / team to apply the abstract level of thinking about  user research, personas, and contextual inquires into a tangible product.  Essentially, it’s the blueprint of the actual product.  


### Persona01 John: Wireflow “John”
John is an almost-retired HR professionals how needs to find information about a workplace accident in a short timeframe.  An employee slipped and fell on a wet surface.  John called and ambulance because the employee had  severe injuries.  While John usually looks up information in a physical book, his book did not have  anything on workplace injuries, so he took to the internet to find an attorney to contact.  John found himself on hrsimple.com.  From this website, he set up a time to talk with an attorney.

### Testing the wireflow with other person 
Since my test was simple, the tester was able to successfully complete her task.  The made aware a few frustrations about the detailed length of the process while performing one of the tasks (John's Task).  Still, afterward she retracted her remark that the wireflow was intuitive and helpful to understand the process for John.

### Reflection

#### Summary of the process, what went smoothly or differently from your expectation

#### What you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. 

For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype.
