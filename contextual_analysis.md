# DH 150: Assignment 4 
## Introductory Steps 

### Step 01: Specify the main design challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users?
This project is meant to support users in finding ways to understand labor and employment law, with specific regards to business owners, managers and human resources personnel.  With this project, I hope to understand how business professional utilize reference materials to learn about laws, compliance and regulation.  Furthermore, I want to learn how the described target audience manages their time in creating employee handbooks, resolving employee disputes, and staying up to date with the rapidly changing world of state and federal employment laws and regulations. 
 
#### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
This activity can fulfill the user’s basic need for security, social, and esteem because it helps business professionals comply with laws that regards safety, employment, assets, belonging, family, friendship, self-worth, accomplishment, and confidence.  It provides security because failure to comply with employment laws is either monetarily costly, or potentially causes a loss of employment.  Employment is a secondary reinforcer because it is essential to monetary gain which allows one to fulfill the physiological needs.  Human Resource departments manage a companies assets — these assets are employees and those employees have specific rights which employers must abide by to continue staying in business.  Belonging, family, friendship all regard managing a companies assets because employees yearn for a sense of belonging in their work, which leads to family and friendship.  Employment laws involve workplace romance, family medical leave act, company and birthday parties, nepotism, and other needs associated with the hierarchy described above.
  
#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Depending on the size of a company, larger organizations solution to satisfy the needs of business and human resources professionals is to contact a law firm or attorney.  Some companies have an attorney on retainer, while others simply contact an attorney when problems go astray.  Other users with a limited budget (majority of small and mid-size companies) might search for information online, or subscribe to newsletter to stay up-to-date on employment law and regulation.  Another possible means to satisfy the needs are to pay for publications or online services.


#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
The current limitation with satisfying the basic need involved with this activity is that employment laws and regulations change through the course of weeks, months, and years.  Not only that, state laws differ from each other and from federal law.  Combining the proper information for business professional to discover what to do when workplace harassment occurs, or when gender and bathroom issues pop-up, is a daunting task.  Also, most employment law is written in legal terms, which makes it difficult for the average layperson to understand how to comply with state and federal employment law.  These limitations make it difficult to find the best digital solution for each business that operates in certain or multiple states in the U.S.  Improving a digital services design to pinpoint the correct affordances with the proper signifiers and optimal service can provide one solution to improving a digital technology for Human Resource professionals.

### Step02: Target users 

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
**Demographic:** proactive business professionals who are responsible for managing one or more employees.
**Preference:** users most likely prefer a service that is inexpensive, easy to use, up-to-date, and informative.   
**Expertise:** no expertise is necessary to conduct this research, but the more expertise one has with managing employees (such as hiring, training, and termination) the better the research outcome.  

#### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
There are several ways users can engage with employment law, regulations, and compliance.  The most obvious one is to obtain a law degree.  Other options are to obtain a master degree in Human Resource.  The most common approach is learning on the job training and years of experience (at least from my observations).  For those without a law degree, business professionals must be proactive in the search for state and federal employment laws and regulation.  Attending conferences, seminars and webinars, and reading news articles and books related to best-practices in the workplace.  For my research, users would perform this activity online by either searching for an answer to their problem/question or going directly to a source, such as an employment law attorney, to learn about a solutions and course of action. 

#### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
Users would search the internet for a specific employment law or go directly to a source like SHRM.org, DOL.gov, or hrsimple.com.  Others may refer to an employment or human resources law book.

### Step03: Pick research methods 
The observation method I plan to employ is passive and participatory observation.

### Insights from the Interview 

####  How do you search for employment law information and updates?
##### from otter.ai transcription // 7:15

“Um, usually, the first thing is quick, simple Google search, then I will second would be to do a search for a law firm that I think may have the answer somewhere within their blogs or webinars or legal update; rarely, but sometimes successfully, I'll go to the federal or state websites Department of Labor websites.”

#### How often do you hear about issues brought up in the news that make you want to learn about that topic (e.g. Amazon unionization)? 
##### from otter.ai transcription // 10:27 

“I knew that they didn't want the the union there was kind of a David and Goliath, but I expected David to win. And so I kind of wanted to know anything I could about what was happening and who was doing what.  [I found more informational] pieces on NPR this weekend about it. Very, very interesting. Just not just from a labor union perspective, but from a psychological philosophical perspective.”

#### Please show me how you search for employment law topics are things that you're interested in regarding owning a business, being a manager or HR professional. 
18:32

“That's [Google search] more than likely where I would start and then browse down through something obviously, that's the word slug or whatever they call it. And then would browse to where or search down looking for something that would interest me or answer my particular need or provide a tangent that would fulfill why I'm there. 

#### and how do you know you when you have found the information you're looking for?  When does your search feel satisfactory? 
20:23

“um when I close that browser window really because I'll go down rabbit holes like I looking at this people also ask what states have a $15 an hour minimum wage that interests me”

#### Perform a similar task I'd like you to go to SHRM.org
23:01

“So my assumption now is that this is there's a paywall involved with all of this stuff, so I'm beginning to lose interest already.”

##### [continuation] You said with the paywall, the paywall upset you, because it came later on? Can you explain that further please?
25:28 

“Well, it's it's, it's getting me deeper and deeper and deeper into the website, which is good from their perspective. But before I'm able to learn anything, it tells me to paywall the […] apple news, when I scroll on my phone on Apple news, it will just say right there, you're paid to read this article. So if it's interesting enough for me to pay for my click, otherwise I just go right by this is, again, not a waste of time.”

### Reflection 
I think stepping away from the website and getting a more holistic view was really important. My participatory observation session was really fruitful and I really enjoyed learning more about what a typical person’s interest in the social issue could be. I had a bit of difficulty with coming up with questions at first but once I started thinking about what I was curious about from a user point of view it was a bit easier. Although not much of my conversation was focused on only the website but rather the social issue that The Advocates for Human Rights organization focuses on, it was really important to get a better understanding of how younger people relate to heavier social issues. My participant offered that he was angry and depressed when reading about certain social issues which is something I hadn’t really considered. It might be interesting to approach how these social issues can be more balanced and presented so that it doesn’t consistently elicit such negative effects. One thing that I found extremely useful was the activities where he researched the topic himself. He expressed confusion on how many refugees there actually are in the world and it seemed like there was misinformation so ensuring the information on the website is clear and concise is very important. Having a narrative that introduces the user to the crisis will help dispel misinformation and build credibility. I also discovered that client stories were engaging to my user and he found them to be helpful in connecting to the cause. A lot of the session was very interesting as I got to see some situations where users might want to contribute but can't because of barriers and figuring out how to showcase the website's online volunteering opportunities is something I want to approach as well. Overall, it was a really interesting session that gave me a little bit more insight about the social cause and move away from my own personal biases.
