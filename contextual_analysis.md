# DH 110: Assignment 3 Contextual Inquiry 
## Introductory Steps 
### Step 01: Specify the main design challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users?
This project is meant to support users in finding ways to understand labor and employment law regarding business owners, managers, and human resources personnel. With this project, I hope to understand how business professionals utilize reference materials to learn about laws, compliance, and regulation. Furthermore, I want to learn how the described target audience manages their time creating employee handbooks, resolving employee disputes, and staying up to date with the rapidly changing world of state and federal employment laws and regulations. 
 
#### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
This activity can fulfill the user's basic need for security, social, and esteem because it helps business professionals comply with laws regarding safety, employment, assets, belonging, family, friendship, self-worth, accomplishment, and confidence. It provides security because failure to comply with employment laws is either monetarily costly or potentially causes a loss of employment. Employment is a secondary reinforcer because it is essential to monetary gain, allowing one to fulfill the physiological needs. Human Resource departments manage a companies assets — these assets are employees, and those employees have specific rights which employers must abide by to continue staying in business. Namely, the psychological needs of belonging, family, and friendship all regard managing a company's assets because I think employees yearn for a sense of belonging in their work. For example, employment laws involve:
Workplace romance.
Family medical leave act.
Company and birthday parties.
Nepotism.
Other needs are associated with the hierarchy described above.
  
#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Depending on the size of a company, a larger organization's solution to satisfy the needs of business and human resources professionals is to contact a law firm or attorney. Some companies have an attorney on retainer, while others contact an attorney when problems go astray. Other users with a limited budget (majority of small and mid-size companies) might search for information online or subscribe to the newsletter to stay up-to-date on employment law and regulation. Another possible means to satisfy the needs is to pay for publications or online services.
 
#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
The current limitation with satisfying the basic need involved with this activity is that employment laws and regulations change over weeks, months, and years. Not only that, state laws differ from each other and federal law. Combining the correct information for a business professional to discover what to do when workplace harassment occurs or when gender and bathroom issues pop-up, is a daunting task. Also, most employment law is written in legal terms, making it difficult for the average layperson to understand how to comply with state and federal employment law. These limitations make it difficult to find the best digital solution for businesses operating in multiple states. Improving a digital services design to pinpoint the correct affordances with the proper signifiers and optimal service can provide one solution to improving digital technology for Human Resource professionals.

### Step 02: Target users 

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
**Demographic:** proactive business professionals who are responsible for managing one or more employees.
**Preference:** users most likely prefer an inexpensive, easy-to-use, up-to-date, and informative service.  
**Expertise:** at least some management experience.

#### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
There are several ways users can engage with employment law, regulations, and compliance. The most obvious one is to obtain a law degree. Other options are to get a master's degree in Human resources. The most common approach is learning on-the-job training and years of experience (at least from my observations). Business professionals must be proactive in searching for state and federal employment laws and regulations for those without a law degree. They could attend conferences, seminars, and webinars and read news articles and books related to best practices in the workplace. For my research, users would perform this activity online by either searching for an answer to their problem/question or go directly to a source, such as an employment law attorney, to learn about solutions and courses of action. 

#### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
Users would search the internet for specific employment law or go directly to a source like SHRM.org, DOL.gov, or hrsimple.com. Others may refer to an employment or human resources law book.

### Step 03: Pick research methods 
The observation method I plan to employ is passive and participatory observation.

### Insights from the Interview 

#### How do you search for employment law information and updates?
##### from otter.ai transcription // 7:15

"Um, usually, the first thing is quick, simple Google search, then I will second would be to do a search for a law firm that I think may have the answer somewhere within their blogs or webinars or legal update; rarely, but sometimes successfully, I'll go to the federal or state websites Department of Labor websites."

#### How often do you hear about issues brought up in the news that makes you want to learn about that topic (e.g. Amazon unionization)? 
##### from otter.ai transcription // 10:27 

"I knew that they didn't want the the union there was kind of a David and Goliath, but I expected David to win. And so I kind of wanted to know anything I could about what was happening and who was doing what. [I found more informational] pieces on NPR this weekend about it. Very, very interesting. Just not just from a labor union perspective, but from a psychological philosophical perspective."

#### Please show me how you search for employment law topics are things that you're interested in regarding owning a business, being a manager or HR professional. 
18:32

"That's [Google search] more than likely where I would start and then browse down through something obviously, that's the word slug or whatever they call it. And then would browse to where or search down looking for something that would interest me or answer my particular need or provide a tangent that would fulfill why I'm there. 

#### and how do you know you when you have found the information you're looking for? When does your search feel satisfactory? 
20:23

"um when I close that browser window really because I'll go down rabbit holes like I looking at this people also ask what states have a $15 an hour minimum wage that interests me"

#### Perform a similar task I'd like you to go to SHRM.org
23:01

"So my assumption now is that this is there's a paywall involved with all of this stuff, so I'm beginning to lose interest already."

##### [continuation] You said with the paywall, the paywall upset you, because it came later on? Can you explain that further please?
25:28 

"Well, it's it's, it's getting me deeper and deeper and deeper into the website, which is good from their perspective. But before I'm able to learn anything, it tells me to paywall the […] apple news, when I scroll on my phone on Apple news, it will just say right there, you're paid to read this article. So if it's interesting enough for me to pay for my click, otherwise I just go right by this is, again, not a waste of time."

### Problems 
In regard to the interview, everything went smoothly except for an authoritative question I asked toward the end of the interview.  I explained this problem in my reflection.  Regarding specific problems with the contextual inquiry, the user showed frustration when he stumbled upon a paywall when performing a passive, participatory task on shrm.org.  Also, problems related to the design challenge is that employment law incidences and issues in the workplace are never the same, so, for small to mid-size business, the interviewee expressed a concern for using  a digital product to find specific answers.  Another problem is legal terms and the need for an interpreter to help an employer understand what is needed to comply with  employment laws.  This was an issue mentioned in the initial design challenge.  

The interviewee thought the interview was engaging and later on, after the recording ended, expressed that the interview was thought-provoking.  

### Reflection 
The contextual inquiry with Brad was a rewarding experience. I know Brad personally and believe both of us walked away learning a lot about this contextual inquiry and managing employment law information for business and partnerships. Regarding the initial interview process, the scripted questions helped gather appropriate information to learn about how and what business professionals think about human resources. Initially, the answers to my questions were straightforward. Still, as we started talking about an essential issue in employment law (like Amazon unionization), I began gathering qualitative data about how Brad searches for information regarding the topic at hand. That is, at first, he said he usually searches for information on the internet with Google, but as our conversation began to unfold, I found the answer I was looking for in this contextual inquiry. Brad revealed that he searches for information online with Google, and he seeks out information through podcasts and other news outlets — at least on unique issues like Amazon Unionization. Another area of importance was that Brad looked for transparency over anything. This fact became apparent when I ask him to search a specific website. He became frustrated because he couldn't find the information he was looking for on the particular website. After he stumbled on a hidden paywall, he became skeptical and further frustrated with his search. He compared transparency to Apple News and how Apple shows content that is part of a paywall, but the paywall is not hidden. Overall, my passive and participatory approach to the contextual inquiry went smoothly except for one question. I repeated a question and stated that previously Brad was vague with his answer. I requested that he give a more specific answer. This approach was not passive, and it seemed to develop an awkward moment for both of us. Another aspect of this interview was that I did not discover the initial design challenge described above. Instead, I learned that the user prefers multiple channels to find information about a given subject. Not only that, I realized that the user would rather communicate with a person, or at least her a voice, or receive customized information from another human being — not a digital technology like a website.
