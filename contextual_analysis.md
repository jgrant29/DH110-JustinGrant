# DH 150: Assignment 4 
## Introductory Steps 

### Step 01: Specify the main design challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users?
This project is meant to support users in finding ways to understand labor and employment law, with specific regards to business owners, managers and human resources personnel.  With this project, I hope to understand how business professional utilize reference materials to learn about laws, compliance and regulation.  Furthermore, I want to learn how the described target audience manages their time in creating employee handbooks, resolving employee disputes, and staying up to date with the rapidly changing world of state and federal employment laws and regulations. 
 
#### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
This activity fulfills the user’s basic need for security, social, and esteem because it helps business professionals comply with laws that regards safety, employment, assets, belonging, family, friendship, self-worth, accomplishment, and confidence.  It provides security because failure to comply with employment laws is either monetarily costly, or potentially causes a loss of employment.  Employment is a secondary reinforcer because it is essential to monetary gain which allows one to fulfill the physiological needs.  Human Resource departments manage a companies assets — these assets are employees and those employees have specific rights which employers must abide by to continue staying in business.  Belonging, family, friendship all regard managing a companies assets because employees yearn for a sense of belonging in their work, which leads to family and friendship.  Employment laws involve workplace romance, family medical leave act, company and birthday parties, nepotism, and other needs associated with the hierarchy described above.
  
#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Depending on the size of a company, larger organizations solution to satisfy the needs of business and human resources professionals is to contact a law firm or attorney.  Some companies have an attorney on retainer, while others simply contact an attorney when problems go astray.  Other users with a limited budget (majority of small and mid-size companies) might search for information online, or subscribe to newsletter to stay up-to-date on employment law and regulation.  Another possible means to satisfy the needs are to pay for publications or online services.


#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
The current limitation with satisfying the basic need involved with this activity is that employment laws and regulations change through the course of weeks, months, and years.  Not only that, state laws differ from other states and from federal law.  Combining the proper information for business professional to discover what to do when workplace harassment occurs, or when gender and bathroom issues pop-up, is a daunting task.  Also, most employment law is written in legalize, which makes it difficult for the average layperson to understand how to comply with state and federal employment law.  These limitations make it difficult to find the best digital solution for each business that operates in certain or multiple states in the U.S.  Improving a digital services design to pinpoint the correct affordances with the proper signifiers and optimal service one solution to improving a digital technology for Human Resource professionals.

### Step02: Target users 

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
**Demographic:** proactive business professionals who are responsible for managing one or more employees.
**Preference:** users most likely prefer a service that is inexpensive, easy to use, up-to-date, and informative.   
**Expertise:** no expertise is necessary to conduct this research, but the more experience one has with managing employees (such as hiring, training, and termination) the better the research.  

#### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
There are several ways users can engage with employment law, regulations, and compliance.  The most obvious one is to obtain a law degree.  Other options are to obtain a master degree in Human Resource.  The most common approach is learning on the job training and years of experience (at least from my observations).  For those without a law degree, business professionals need to be proactive in the search for state and federal employment laws and regulation.  Attending conferences, seminars and webinars, and reading news articles and books related to best-practices in the workplace.  For my research, users would perform this activity online by either searching endless for an answer to their problem or going directly to a source to learn about a problem. 

#### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
Users would search the internet for a specific employment law or go directly to a source like SHRM.org, DOL.gov, or hrsimple.com.  Others may refer to an employment or human resources law book.

### Step03: Pick research methods 
The observation method I plan to employ is passive and participatory observation.

### Insights from the Interview 
#### How important is it to you to volunteer in a group? 
Part 1 // 11:00 

I definitely think that [volunteering with] a group makes me feel like I'm a part of something. And it kind of shows that like it's not just me caring about it, there are multiple people that care, and that we want to show that, hey, there is already there's this family or this group that wants to make a change, and we want you to join that change. So I definitely think that having a group organization is definitely almost vital to for social change.

#### What do you think are some potential pros to volunteering with a small organization versus a larger organization? 
Part 1 // 14:29 

I definitely think that when you're volunteering with a smaller organization, you definitely have more of a sense of community within your organization, and you can kind of get to know how the organization is really making a difference on a more personal level. So I definitely think that that's a pro but I also think that with a smaller organization, you likely won't be able to make as much change as you would like, as if you were to have a larger organization where you trade off something personal experience and that personal connection to the organization for the chance that having a greater impact

#### What are your thoughts after reading the client story? How did it make you feel? 
Part 2 // 12:40  

I initially chose it because I know that China has very heavy censorship, and they have denied that Tianmen happened. So that just hearing of what happened Tianmen square back in the late 80s iinitially drew me in. Reading Mr. Wu’s story definitely made me angry because he would face imprisonment if you were to go back. But I'm also somewhat angry because even though he's gone through this process for years at this point, and he's just worked very hard with multiple attorneys through his organization, he still wasn't granted asylum. That made me angry at how inefficient the immigration process is in America. And it kind of ended on a sad note that
he wasn't able to reunite with his family. That kind of made me feel like I need to help. It somewhat humanized Mr. W to where I feel a need to help people such as Mr. Wu who are affected by this crisis.


#### [After completing activities] Does reading more about the stories affect how connected you feel to the issue? 
Part 3 // 1:04  

I definitely think that by having the names of lawyers creates that personal connection between you, the reader and the organization themselves, and helps show that it's not just like this big corporation, but rather, it's people working usually long hours, so that they can make a difference in the world. And it kind of makes me feel like I am somewhat obliged to do like to support them. 


### Reflection 
I think stepping away from the website and getting a more holistic view was really important. My participatory observation session was really fruitful and I really enjoyed learning more about what a typical person’s interest in the social issue could be. I had a bit of difficulty with coming up with questions at first but once I started thinking about what I was curious about from a user point of view it was a bit easier. Although not much of my conversation was focused on only the website but rather the social issue that The Advocates for Human Rights organization focuses on, it was really important to get a better understanding of how younger people relate to heavier social issues. My participant offered that he was angry and depressed when reading about certain social issues which is something I hadn’t really considered. It might be interesting to approach how these social issues can be more balanced and presented so that it doesn’t consistently elicit such negative effects. One thing that I found extremely useful was the activities where he researched the topic himself. He expressed confusion on how many refugees there actually are in the world and it seemed like there was misinformation so ensuring the information on the website is clear and concise is very important. Having a narrative that introduces the user to the crisis will help dispel misinformation and build credibility. I also discovered that client stories were engaging to my user and he found them to be helpful in connecting to the cause. A lot of the session was very interesting as I got to see some situations where users might want to contribute but can't because of barriers and figuring out how to showcase the website's online volunteering opportunities is something I want to approach as well. Overall, it was a really interesting session that gave me a little bit more insight about the social cause and move away from my own personal biases.
